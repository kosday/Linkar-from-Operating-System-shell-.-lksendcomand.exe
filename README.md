This demo is an script (cmd or sh) that shows the working of several calls to the lksendcommand.exe executable with different arguments.

For each call to the executable a direct call of the LinkarClient SendCommand will be made and it will return the required information in the requested format.
 
If you are in a UX system you must go to the LKSENDCOMMAND folder and Modify the script "demo_lksendcommand.sh" with your login data and run it.

If you are in a Windows system you must go to the LKSENDCOMMAND folder and Modify the bat file "demo_lksendcommand.cmd" with your login data and run it.


The login information that is defined in the script variables will be used for each call to the executable.

For each call, a result file will be created in the folder where the script is located.
